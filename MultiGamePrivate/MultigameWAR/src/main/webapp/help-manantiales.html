        <h1>Basics</h1>
        <p>
            Tokens are dragged from the left onto the game board in the center of the screen, when the player has
            his/her turn.  Players can only drag tokens onto cells (territories) that they own.  Ownership is demarked by
            the background color of each cell, with each player having a corresponding color to that beneath each
            territory.  You can determine each player's color by looking at the player list on the right side of the
            screen and 
        </p>
        <p>
            During puzzle mode, players can suggest other players move tokens they own to different locations on the
            board.  Players may only make 1 suggestion per player during their own turn.  Suggestions are made by dragging
            other users tokens to the desired location.  Note:  dragging other player's tokens is subject to the same set
            of restrictions as your own tokens (Intensive's cannot be adjacent to one another, all tokens must be within
            a user's territory or on the riparian trees forming the boundary).
        </p>
        <h1>Play</h1>
        <p>
            Manantiales consists of a board divided into four territories bordered by four creeks.
            Each of the four players have the task of colonizing one territory. The entire locale consists of
            forty-eight sites. Each site represents one Hectare (or any other unit of measurement, for example, acres,
            square miles, etc). One large blue token represents the main spring. It is located in the center of the
            board. Forty-eight green tokens represent virgin forest or secondary re-growth during play. A simple table
            that counts olive tokens removed from the board during development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each player colonizing a quadrant has thirty tokens, divided into lots of six, representing five types of
            land use. Each type of use has a distinct value (F equates to Forest Management and is valued at one;
            M equals Moderate Grazing and is valued at two; I equates to Intensive grazing and is valued at three,
            E equates to Grassland Exclusion for Silvopastoral System Establishment and has no value; S equates to a
            productive silvopastoral system and is valued at four).
        </p>
        <p>
            In the competitive game, a random number from 1-6 is displayed and chosen by the player on each turn.  If
            it is a “6,” the player has experienced a “bad year” and loses his/her turn.  In the puzzle game, no such
            device is used.  Players are allowed to make any legal move once it is their turn.
        </p>
        <p>
            A player colonizes a chosen site with a token that represents one possible type of development. Some tokens
            may be placed freely in any location, while others may not. Each different type of development is valued
            distinctly. Points awarded per type of colonization, allow residents to acquire “material benefits” These
            benefits are available to the player when he/she attains a certain number of points, and are represented
            by a specific resource card. In the competitive mode of the game, whoever meets a specified number of
            points first, wins the game. In the puzzle mode, all players must meet the winning score, otherwise, all
            lose the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most types of development involve site deforestation. If the total deforestation exceeds a certain
            threshold, the spring that supplies water to the players dries up, all residents must migrate and all
            players lose the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            The same occurs if more than two sites surrounding the main spring are deforested. in the case that more
            than two sites on a creek are deforested, that creek temporarily runs out of water and the neighboring
            players lose all development in that locale, except for sites that are “managed forest.” These lost sites
            may be recolonized on the subsequent turn by whoever chooses to do so first.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a player creates any of the above three situations, the next player must avoid “check-mate”
            by reforesting the proper site and resolving the condition; this involves the subtraction of points from a
            player’s current score.
        </p>
        <h1>Modalities</h1>
        <p>
            How many ways can this game be played?
        </p>
        <p>
            The game has two land development versions: (A) Land development with conventional land use: managed
            forest, moderate ranching with moderate grazing, ranching with intense (over)grazing. And (B) Land
            development with conventional land use and a silvo-pastoral innovation. These two versions can be played
            in two social modalities:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Competition: the first player that reaches a certain number of points wins (24/32pts).</li>
                <li>Cooperation: collective planning for equity.  Everyone works to solve the game as a puzzle which can
                    only be resolved when all players have the number of points required to win. (24/32pts).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            What this means is that the game can spin through 4 different sections, starting in the following order:
            <ol>
                <li>"Classic" competitive mode</li>
                <li>"Basic Puzzle" puzzle mode</li>
                <li>"Silvopastoral" competitive mode</li>
                <li>"Advanced PUzzle" puzzle mode</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Players may initiate games at any of the above modalities while configuring new games.
