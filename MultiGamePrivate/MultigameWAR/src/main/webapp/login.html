            This is the network server for the computer assisted participatory modeling project at El Colegio de La
            Frontera Sur (ECOSUR) in San Cristobal de Las Casas, funded by CONACYT.  We have placed computer games developed
            here as a result of our ongoing research in the Tablon watershed at the La Sepultura UNESCO world heritage
            site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our computer games implement board games created by researchers and stakeholders in La Sepultura. These
            games have been adapted and/or extended for online play.  We follow the
            <a href="http://www.ecole-commod.sc.chula.ac.th/www2/index.php">COMMOD</a> process, with our results being
            based primarily on the gaming aspects of participatory modeling but also making use of multi-agent modeling
            for experimentation and artificial intelligence.

           <h3>GAMES</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, we host two rule based games, GENTE and MANANTIALES, with our rules based platform.

        </p>
        <p> Gente is a fairly simple board game, adapted from "PENTE" and played on a go-type board.  The work was
            developed to explore self-centered versus selfless behaviors in the context of a four player, team based,
            game.  Players compete as a team and against each other by striving to create 2 sets of three aligned tokens
            of the same color (individual competition) or 3 sets of four aligned tokens whch mix team colors.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Manantiales is more complicated than Gente, and is the amalgamation of
            several earlier model games and discussions begun at ECOSUR during the ARIDNet workshop in July of 2008.
            Although Gente has been played with stakeholders across the spectrum, the abstraction of the game made it
            difficult for stakeholders to help us completely extend and adapt the game from our initial design.  Work
            on interactive game rules is progressing to try and address this challenge from the computer assisted
            perspective. In the case of Manantiales, we have had very active stakeholder participation and
            co-development starting with the AridNET workshop and working through many sessions and workshops in the
            field, government offices in Tuxtla Gutierrez and in the academic environment here at ECOSUR.
        </p>
        <p>
           <h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            As we mention above, our games have been developed following the COMMOD process, first articulated by F.
            Bousquet and Guy Trebuil (et. al.) in the seminal paper, <a href="http://cormas.cirad.fr/pdf/adveem.pdf">
            "An environmental modeling approach: the use of multi-agent simulations."</a>  We have focused our work on
            iterative game designs with a structure faithful to environmental models while using Game Theory to qualify
            outcomes and AI participation.  In the case of Manantiales, modeling works to express a stylized simulation
            of what is actually occurring through development in the Tablon watershed/Sepultura buffer zone.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>ARCHITECTURE</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            The diagram that follows is a simplified view of our JEE rules based architecture for games.  We use a
            distributed architecture, allowing our games to be edited, modified and run on a variety of client
            platforms and our server software to scale to any size.  Our current iteration includes a Flash based
            gaming client; but clients can be developed and written in a variety of technologies that allow for RPC,
            SOAP or REST based messaging to signal our backend implementation.  We are currently thinking about
            implementations for smaller handheld devices (Android, XHTML, WML) as well as Apple iPad/iPhone devices.
            We are very interested in collaborating with software developers who have an interest in our project and
            any of these platforms.
        </p>
        <img align="center" src="img/architecture.png" alt="MultiGame Architecture Diagram"/>
        <p>
            As I mention above, the diagram only roughly sketches some of the structure of our backend implementation.
            A common model, described by a set of interfaces and serializable container classes (the Bridge Pattern)
            interact with a set of common EJBs capable of being externalized via REST or SOAP protocols.  We use the
            Drools rules engine to govern interactions in the game as well as the AI implementation (a fully runnable
            multi-agent system when considered from a COMMOD perspective).  Agents act through rules triggered by
            modifications to the underlying set of entity beans which act as an implementation of the common model on a
            per game basis. Agents and the game itself communicate change by means of a JMS Topic queue; which notifies
            Agent implementations attached to the JMS message bus by means of MessageDrivenBeans and BLAZEDS signaling
            to the Flash user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code staged on <a href="http://chiapasgames.net">chiapasgames.net</a> comes from a private repository
            which will soon be made public.  Interested software developers (and computer scientists) can view the
            common and public version of our source code (including all common libraries, EJBs and the implementation of the game of Gente and its
            agents) on the following URL at GitHub:

            <a href="http://github.com/awaterma/MultiGamePublic">http://github.com/awaterma/MultiGamePublic</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our private repository is driven out of concurrent work being done in the development branch of the
            public repository.
