GETTING STARTED

This README requires you to have installed the following products:

1.  Sun's opensource Application Server, GLASSFISH.
    * available from:  https://glassfish.dev.java.net/public/downloadsindex.html
    * We have been using version 2.1 during development.
2.  Adobe's open source FLEX3.4 SDK
    * available from:  http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Flex+SDK
3.  MultiGamePublic
    * available from:  http://awaterma.github.com/MultiGame

MultiGamePublic must be built and installed with maven before attempting to install
this set of private code due to public dependencies.

All other dependencies are managed by means of Maven.

GLASSFISH CONFIGURATION

The following configuration changes must be made on the Glassfish server to which
the EAR file is being deployed:

1.  A JMS connection factory must be created with the following details:
    a) "Name" set to "jms/TopicConnectionFactory"
    b) "Transaction Support" set to "NoTransaction"
    c) Remove the username and password properties from "Additional Properties" 
    d) All other fields may remain in default state.

2.  A new JMS "destination resource" must be created with the following details:
    a) "Name" set to "MultiGame"
    b) "Resource Type" set to "javax.jms.Topic"
    c) All other fields may remain in default state.
 
 
 MAVEN CONFIGURATION
 
This prototype requires the following environmental changes be made, before being
built and deployed.

1.  The environmental property "GLASSFISH_HOME" must be set by the builder to 
point to the top-level directory of glassfish-v2.1.
2.  The environmental property "FLEX_SDK" must be set by the builder to point to the top-
level directory of the FLEX 3.4 SDK.

For example, in BASH, you would do the following:

export GLASSFISH_HOME=/home/myuser/glassfish
export FLEX_SDK=/home/myuser/flex_sdk
    
 **** IMPORTANT ****
 
 Before deployment, the local Glassfish Derby database must be up and running:
 
 %> asadmin start-database
