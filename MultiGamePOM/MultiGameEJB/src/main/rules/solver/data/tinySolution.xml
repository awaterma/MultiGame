    This file sets up a test starting solution
    for the drools solver against the manatiales
    game.
    
    As all manantiales games are initialized with 
    a set of undeveloped tokens already, xml files
    of this type simply need to locate the placed
    tokens for a solution on the board, as well
    as their color and type.
    
    To start, we use the known equitable solution, 
    (4-4-4-4) with a small tweek to test that the
    solver is correctly configured.
